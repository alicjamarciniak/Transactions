# Bank Transactions app

Application to visualising and modifing list of bank transactions served by local server.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
  
 **Application is not fully functional at this moment.** 
 Unfortunatelly that's all I was able to do in specified time. I hope that this sample of code will be enough for you to evaluate my skills.


## How to run project

1. Run JSON server in terminal: `yarn run server` / `npm srun server` [PORT 3000]

2. Run app in second terminal: `yarn start` / `npm start` [PORT 8000]
